                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Hi,  I'm Gabe Zeller, a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign pursuing a 
                    degree in Geographic Information Science with a minor in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion lies in coding, and I have particularly enjoyed learning Java and C++ during my 
                    academic journey. This fall 2023 semester, I'm eagerly anticipating courses on Data Structures 
                    in C++ and Environmental Data Science, which will introduce me to coding in R.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my precise career goals are yet to be defined, I find satisfaction in working
                     with data through programming and plan to further explore this area. I'm on track to complete my degree in the Fall of 2025.

                <h2>Triangle Fraternity</h2>
                <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I actively participate in the Illinois chapter of Triangle Fraternity, a 
                    unique organization that brings together STEM majors. Initially, I had not considered joining Greek life, 
                    but during the second half of my freshman year, I discovered Triangle and was drawn to its distinctive community.
                </p>
                <p>As a member, one of my most cherished experiences was serving as the float chair for the UIUC 2022 Homecoming parade. 
                    I took on the responsibility of designing and constructing our float, which featured a Stranger Things theme. 
                    I handcrafted a Demi-Dog from the show and, aiming for an ambitious touch, arranged for a live band of musically inclined 
                    Triangle members to play 80's music from the series on the moving float. (Float pictured on the right).

                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p>I am a lover of live music, and I frequently attend local shows both in my hometown of Peoria and in the Champaign-Urbana area.
                    I especially enjoy it when there is a mosh pit! In general, I enjoy most music, but my favorite is metal and hardcore. 
                    Currently, I love listening to
                    Slipknot, Deftones, and Knocked Loose. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fitness has been a significant part of my life since my high school cross-country days. While I may not always maintain 
                    a strict routine, I genuinely enjoy lifting at the gym and going for runs whenever possible. My interest in fitness 
                    extends to nutrition, and I pay close attention to my dietary choices to align them with my fitness goals.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to my love for music and fitness, I also find joy in longboarding, especially around campus, exploring 
                    fashion through thrifting, spending time outdoors, appreciating the oxford comma, and learning about spirits and distilling &#8212 something
                I discovered after working at a local small batch distillery.</p>
