                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Gabe Zeller and I am a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Geographic Information 
                    Science with a minor in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite thing so far as a student has been learning to code in Java and C++ between various courses. I am looking forward to this fall 2023
                    semester where I will take Data Structures in C++ and a course titled Environmental Data Science where I will learn to code in R. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My exact goals are unknown, but so far I enjoy dealing with data via code and will keep exploring this avenue. I expect to complete my degree in the Fall of 2025.
                </p>

                <h2>Triangle Fraternity</h2>
                <p>Much of my time outside of academics is spent as a member of the Illinois chapter of Triangle Fraternity. 
                    I had no intention of joining greek life when I went to college, but during the second half of my
                    freshman year, I learned about Triangle, a fraternity of STEM majors, and found this was a unique
                    group I wanted to be a part of.
                </p>
                <p>One of favorite memories was my experience as our float chair. This meant I was responsible for designing and building
                    our float for the UIUC 2022 Homecoming parade. I went with a Stranger Things theme, hand-making a Demi-Dog from the show, and 
                    decided to be ambitious by having a live band on the float consisting of our more musical members who played
                    80's music from the show. Float is pictured right.

                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p>I am a lover of live music. My favorite thing to do is go to local shows around my hometown of Peoria or in the Champaign-Urbana area. 
                    I especially enjoy it when there is a mosh pit! In general, I enjoy most music, but my favorite is metal and hardcore. Currently, I love listening to
                    Slipknot, Deftones, and Knocked Loose. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I began running cross country in high school, I have been into fitness. Although I am not always consistent, I do enjoy 
                    lifting at the gym and going on runs when I make time for it. I also find nutrition very interesting. When I feel necessary, I pay close attention to what I eat in relation to my fitness goals.
                </p>
                <p>Some other things that I enjoy are longboarding (especially around campus), fashion, thrifting, being outdoors, the oxford comma, and learning about spirits and distilling. </p>
